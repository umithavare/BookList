# BookList

* The Book class consists of variables such as book name, page count, author's name, and publication date.

* Create 10 objects from the Book class and store them in an ArrayList structure. Using the stream structure and lambda expressions, write it in a way that will create a new Map<String, String> where the book name will be the key, and the corresponding author name will be the value.

* From this list of 10 Book items, develop a filter that will provide a new list of books with more than 100 pages. (You can use Stream and Lambda expressions.)
